# Watch Dogs Asset Pack (Icons)
This is a Watch Dogs themed asset pack for the Flipper Zero. 
You can combine it with the Watch Dogs asset pack which is included in Momentum Firmware.
## Installation for Momentum Firmware
1. Copy the Watch_Dogs folder into `SD Card/asset_packs`
2. Go to `Momentum/Interface/Graphics/Asset Pack`
3. Change the asset pack to __Watch_Dogs__
> I highly recommend to use this pack with another WatchDogs themed asset pack since this one only includes custom icons.
